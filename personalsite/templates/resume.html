I am an Australian Data Scientist working at BCG Gamma in NYC. My priority is to help you get value from your data and codebase. I believe successful data science projects require a combination of technical skill, and, ability to frame and communicate the business problem. I champion these skills in myself and in team environments. 
</p>

<p>
I joined The Boston Consulting Group in July 2019 as a Senior Data Scientist. During my time at BCG I have rapidly grown in expertise and business acumen. My focus has been on personalization projects in the marketing and services practice, and more recently working on COVID related scenario planning. We use data science to provide the right offer, to the right person, at the right time. I have developed into a ‘full stack’ data scientist, able to manage and execute programs end-to-end from inception to technical implementation to delivery.
</p>

<p>
In April 2019 I completed a Masters of Computer Science from Georgia Tech, majoring in Machine Learning. This covered challenging topics; statistics, deep learning, AI, big data, and algorithms.
</p>

<p>
At Evolve Research, my last Melbourne based employer, we utilized these skills in solving data problems in the market research industry. I was the Head of Data Science for three years, with five years prior as a market research consultant. I led a team of junior analysts, graduates and software engineers to deliver analytical solutions to in-house consultants or direct to ongoing client relationships. Our function also included research and development work, with the aim of producing innovation in the market research industry.
</p>

<p>
During my time at Evolve, we created an innovative chatbot application to enhance respondent engagement. This project was selected in response to more demand for shorter more text based surveys. This approach has been successfully rolled out to multiple clients for different use cases.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we deployed a python API to serve the chatbot to our in-house survey software. This effort required a combination of data science skills, software engineering, cloud hosting, and web technologies to serve the analytical solutions. We extended this into another proof of concept to serve consultant analysis requests through a self-service web interface.
</p>

<p>
In terms of our core business as data analysts, typical requests usually included driver analysis (regression), segmentation, forecasting and NLP requests. For NLP we would work with respondent open-ended feedback about brands and products. 
</p>

<p>
We created tools for a major retailer to identify when respondents had feedback on particular items as it related to stock issues, quality, price, and other ‘hot topics’. Here, the hot topics were always respondent generated such as capturing additional chatter about holiday seasons or extreme weather. This information helped our client identify stores with poor quality products or those which were providing exceptionally good service. 
</p>

<p>
On the technical side, these projects required a range of skills such as secure website and API development, dashboard and docker solutions on Azure. Our NLP approach utilized LSTM neural networks for sentiment scoring and entity detection, and enhanced dictionary approaches for chatbot and AI routines.
</p>

<p>
Before Evolve I worked at The Klein Partnership (TKP), a boutique market research agency in Melbourne for 3 years. At TKP and Evolve I worked across multiple industries in a quantitative and qualitative research capacity. 
</p>

<p>
I joined TKP after graduating from The University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts, having studied a double major in Psychology and Political Science. These studies greatly expanded my world view, ability to communicate complex ideas and contributed to my interest in travel. Over the past few years my partner and I have lived and worked remotely, which has developed my capabilities to work and lead asynchronously with a mix of teams.

Starting work at BCG was an incredibly exciting, anxious and stressful time. Through the first weeks I was still in shock at times that I was really there and had the opportunity to work for such a renown company. Performance anxiety and imposter syndrome is a big thing, and a common topic for new starters. In this article I want to discuss my thoughts about starting in July 2019, and some practical ideas to help people who were in my position.

A common piece of advice I received when joining was to ‘ask lots of questions’. There is a saying I quite like and talk about which goes ‘A well phrased question is half the answer’. A question needs to communicate to the audience what you are unsure about, but couched in a context of what you don’t know, and asking for help to bridge the gap. The issue initially is that you don’t know what you don’t know! It’s very hard to ask insightful questions. The following are a list of some good topics and questions to ask people, hopefully this leads into rich territory to ask more questions. You want to be at a point where you feel like you’re on solid ground, or put another way that you have some rocks in the stream you can anchor to, to move on into more unfamiliar territory. You need to build up the schema of knowledge which others may take for granted but you will need to assimilate quickly, not just for your first case but all cases.

So here is a list of things to ask about;

The people. Ask about who is on the case team, who is on the client team, who reports to who and how people are related. Go away and do research both on linked-in and other internal sites to better understand where people fit together. It can help to draw up some diagrams connecting people. Along the way, make some notes even if some things feel weird to write down, such as married status, where they studied, where took holiday, etc. The aim is not to be a creeper but use these as cues to quickly learn people’s names and understand the landscape.

Infrastructure and access. Particularly for technical people like those in Gamma, it can be a great asset to yourself and others to start diagramming what the infrastructure state looks like. It took me almost 3 months on my case to fully start to understand how everything was set up and fit together, along with the methods of access. This information can come in handy for documentation efforts for later handovers to clients or onboarding for others.

Similar to the above, create a data dictionary. Understand where data comes from, who is responsible for it, who knows what information to describe the data and how it is used. An unexpected approach we took was to rank data sources by their ‘popularity’, that is, how widely used they were by people in the project. This helps head off any issues with the team using stale data or incorrect references. Be a stickler for data formats and naming.

Any repeated task you do, even manual work, write it up as if it is a program, then execute. I wrote the process for logging into my computer, onto the VPN access, and starting up work in clusters. This is a good way to store (non secret) process code, as well as provide a central place to make small productivity improvements. While you’re busy getting used to everything else on the case, this will be one less thing you have to think about in the morning when starting the day.

Always be documenting. Any code you write, document why you are writing it and what the functions are designed to do. Do this early and do this in docstring format. This will save you a  lot of time during handovers and also support good code reviews.

Your on boarding experience is everyones, contribute! It is unlikely that you will be the last person to join the case. For the people on the case, their memory of what it’s like to start off fresh has passed, but try not to let your memory pass so easily. If you can document, show process for onboarding to others, they can take on the responsibility to make improvements to the process.

Lastly, remember that you can always ask for help, we’re not alone in this as consultants. Reach out to colleagues you have met, ask them what they would do in your situation. A related problem here is that there are a LOT of resources available so it can be hard to know where exactly to go to ask for help. I would suggest start with your project lead, other people at your level on the case, people you’ve met from trainings, your Gamma buddy if you have one, and then start to navigate the more formal support structures that Gamma provides for various functions and issues. I’m lucky that I started at the same time as three other data scientists in my home office. Along the way we’ve shared a lot about our experiences and perspectives as well as 
asking for help with often easy questions.

Hopefully this gives you some useful things to think about implementing, reduce your anxiety and help you enjoy your work. It can be a lot of fun and very rewarding once you’re geared up so enjoy it!
